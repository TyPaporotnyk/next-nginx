Many people who remained whole and undamaged think they have no scars. But they do - in their heads. The war has 'shrunken' a significant part of society. My dream is for everyone to understand this and stop trying to rebuild old structures. We need to create something new, implement bold ideas, and move forward,\" emphasized Yuri Hudyimenko.</p><br><p>According to the military man, many people in power do not understand how to deal with the new challenges of society. Therefore, public initiatives need to be promoted persistently. This also applies to how veterans are treated, social support, and communication etiquette with them.</p><br><p>The evening traditionally ended with an autograph session with the author, group photos, and friendly hugs.
